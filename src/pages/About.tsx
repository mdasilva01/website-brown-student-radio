          “The Brown Network” began in 1936 as the first student-run radio
          station in the country. It was a carrier-current AM station
          broadcasting to Brown dorms. Eventually the station’s name was changed
          to “WBRU-AM.” In 1966, some of the station’s members secured a loan
          from the University and founded the radio station WBRU-FM (95.5),
          while others continued the student-oriented AM tradition. WBRU-FM
          became a commercial corporation, financially and legally separate from
          Brown University, while WBRU-AM continued to operate for the Brown
          community and surrounding areas in the college radio tradition. The AM
          signal in time became virtually inaudible. During the mid-1990s, a few
          students worked to find a new, more audible outlet for those still
          broadcasting in the older, experimental, student tradition. In 1997,
          WBRU-AM became “Brown Student Radio” (BSR) and started broadcasting on
          WELH-FM (88.1). WELH-FM, owned by the Wheeler School, was sold to
          another organization in 2010, leaving BSR to broadcast solely on
          bsrlive.com.

          In 2018, BSR obtained a low-power FM license. As WBRU-FM had sold
          their signal the year prior, BSR obtained the call signal WBRU-LP. BSR
          is now broadcasting on 101.1 FM, online, and through an upcoming
          mobile app.​​ Today, we are the only FM radio station on campus,
          staying true to our roots in traditional freeform college radio.
          Students, faculty, and community members all host cross-genre music
          shows, podcasts, and talk shows, allowing for a truly free creative
          outlet for the Providence community. We are officially partnered with
          PCR and AS220.
